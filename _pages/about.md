I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/home.html">Alessandro Abate</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/david.parker/home.html">Dave Parker</a>. 

My research interests lie in formal verification and machine learning, particularly focusing on probabilistic systems with epistemic uncertainty and data-driven methods for optimal policy synthesis and uncertainty quantification. Recently, my work has also explored data-driven learning of abstractions for software verification.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my Master's degree at Oxford and my undergraduate studies at Saarland University, where I was a research assistant with <a href="https://depend.cs.uni-saarland.de/~hermanns/">Holger Hermanns</a>.

Over the summer, I am interning with the Formal Verification team at Apple.
